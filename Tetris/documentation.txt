How to use the engine interface
you are free to use command line arguments however you want, communication will be done through stdin (incoming from game) and stdout (engine to game)

Generally, anything that isn't what the game expects will be ignored, so you can write info logs to stdout as you please (including fancy intro text when the engine boots)

Option parse:
Engine can supply options during this step, the game will respond with an ack when ready or kill is sent

ready - will resume execution with the supplied settings
kill - will instruct the game to kill the engine
option seed - will set the current seed (slightly different during the game)
option garbage - will set the garbage interval (examples: "none" - no garbage, "1-100" - 1 line of garbage every 100 frames, "1-100 2-150" - 1 line of garbage every 100 frames AND 2 lines of garbage every 150 frames)

Startup:
an option parse will happen here, use this time to load libraries and load the model or whatever before the game starts

Game loop:

The game will request a move with a bunch of commands as follows
board - the current state of the board as 40 integer values, each one being a row from bottom to top and bitwise left to right    examples: 1 -> x.........   985 -> x..xx.xxxx   176 -> ....xx.x..
placing - letter of the piece currently being placed (one of I J L O S T Z)
rotation - rotation of the piece currently being placed (int 0-3)
position - the position of the piece currently being placed (two ints x y (x=0 is left, y=0 is bottom, measured at the top left corner of the piece))
held - the piece currently held (0 if none)
hasheld - whether the engine has held a piece this turn (true/false)
next - next 3 pieces in the queue (piece 1 2 3)
incoming - amount of garbage that's incoming (int)

this will be followed by a single "move" command, telling the engine to thonk

the engine will be expected to output "move [move]", where [move] is one of either left, right, hard, soft, cw, ccw, or hold, anything not starting with "move" will be ignored.

then, the game will send the results of the move back to the engine as follows (or if the game ended, will instead do the game over section)
lines - how many lines were cleared (int)
sent - how much garbage was sent (int)
b2b - if the engine is currently in the back to back state (true/false)
combo - the current line clearing combo (int)
invalidmove - if the move was invalid (bumping into a wall) and defaulted to a softdrop (true/false)
repeatedmove - if the move sent the piece to a spot it's been to before, sending a softdrop to prevent loops (true/false)

the game will then start another option parse, which can either be skipped by simply returning "ready", or you can change the settings
changing the seed here will send you to the game over state, which you will then need to set the seed again for it to register in the next game

Game over:
when the game ends due to being topped out, the game will send a "gameover" command, and will start another parse options
